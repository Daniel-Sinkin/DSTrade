Optionally, you can use VARIANCE(annualized=True)to normalized the output to an annual value.

Optionally, you can use STDDEV(annualized=True)to normalized the output to an annual value.

By default, bins=10. Use HISTOGRAM(bins=20) to specify a custom bin value (e.g., 20).\\nAUTOCORRELATION: For each symbol place, calculate the autocorrelation for the given lag (e.g., the lag in neighboring points for the autocorrelation calculation). By default, lag=1. Use AUTOCORRELATION(lag=2) to specify a custom lag value (e.g., 2).\\nCOVARIANCE: Returns a covariance matrix for the input symbols. Optionally, you can use COVARIANCE(annualized=True)to normalized the output to an annual value.
