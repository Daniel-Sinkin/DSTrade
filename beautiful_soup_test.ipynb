      "Description:\n",
      "This API returns current and 20+ years of historical intraday OHLCV time series of the equity specified, coveringpre-market and post-market hourswhere applicable (e.g., 4:00am to 8:00pm Eastern Time for the US market). You can query both raw (as-traded) and split/dividend-adjusted intraday data from this endpoint. The OHLCV data is sometimes called \"candles\" in finance literature.\n",

      "API Parameters:\n",
      "❚ Required: function\n",
      "The time series of your choice. In this case, function=TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY\n",
      "❚ Required: symbol\n",
      "The name of the equity of your choice. For example: symbol=IBM\n",
      "❚ Required: interval\n",
      "Time interval between two consecutive data points in the time series. The following values are supported: 1min , 5min , 15min , 30min , 60min\n",
      "❚ Optional: adjusted\n",
      "By default, adjusted=true and the output time series is adjusted by historical split and dividend events. Set adjusted=false to query raw (as-traded) intraday values.\n",
      "❚ Optional: extended_hours\n",
      "By default, extended_hours=true and the output time series will include both the regular trading hours and the extended (pre-market and post-market) trading hours (4:00am to 8:00pm Eastern Time for the US market). Set extended_hours=false to query regular trading hours (9:30am to 4:00pm US Eastern Time) only.\n",
      "❚ Optional: month\n",
      "By default, this parameter is not set and the API will return intraday data for the most recent days of trading.
